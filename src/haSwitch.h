/**
 * The mqtt switch platform lets you control your MQTT enabled switches. In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state_topic to publish state changes.
 * If these messages are published with a RETAIN flag, the MQTT switch will receive an instant state update after subscription, and will start with the correct state.
 * Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be false / off.
 *
 * When a state_topic is not available, the switch will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the switch will immediately change state after every command.
 * Otherwise, the switch will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from state_topic).
 *
 * Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the state_topic is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect switch operation.
 *

 * An example of switch discovery message may be like this:
 *
